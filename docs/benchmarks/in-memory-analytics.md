This benchmark uses Apache Spark and runs a collaborative filtering algorithm
in-memory on a dataset of user-movie ratings. The metric of interest is the
time in seconds of computing movie recommendations.

The explosion of accessible human-generated information necessitates automated
analytical processing to cluster, classify, and filter this information.
Recommender systems are a subclass of information filtering system that seek to
predict the 'rating' or 'preference' that a user would give to an item.
Recommender systems have become extremely common in recent years, and are
applied in a variety of applications. The most popular ones are movies, music,
news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in
general. Because these applications suffer from I/O operations, nowadays, most
of them are running in memory. This benchmark runs the alternating least
squares (ALS) algorithm which is provided by Spark MLlib.

### Getting the Image

Current version of the benchmark is 4.0. To obtain the image:

    $ docker pull cloudsuite/in-memory-analytics:4.0

### Datasets

The benchmark uses user-movie ratings datasets provided by Movielens. To get
the dataset image:

    $ docker pull cloudsuite/movielens-dataset:4.0

More information about the dataset is available at
[cloudsuite/movielens-dataset][ml-dhrepo].

### Running the Benchmark

The benchmark runs the ALS algorithm on Spark through the spark-submit script
distributed with Spark. It takes two arguments: the dataset to use for
training, and the personal ratings file to give recommendations for. Any
remaining arguments are passed to spark-submit.

The cloudsuite/movielens-dataset image has two datasets (one small and one
large), and a sample personal ratings file.

To run a benchmark with the small dataset and the provided personal ratings
file:

    $ docker create --name movielens-data cloudsuite/movielens-dataset:4.0
    $ docker run --rm --volumes-from movielens-data cloudsuite/in-memory-analytics:4.0 \
        /data/ml-latest-small /data/myratings.csv

### Tweaking the Benchmark

Any arguments after the two mandatory ones are passed to spark-submit and can
be used to tweak execution. For example, to ensure that Spark has enough memory
allocated to be able to execute the benchmark in-memory, supply it with
--driver-memory and --executor-memory arguments:

    $ docker run --rm --volumes-from movielens-data cloudsuite/in-memory-analytics:4.0 \
        /data/ml-latest /data/myratings.csv \
        --driver-memory 2g --executor-memory 2g

### Multi-node deployment

This section explains how to run the benchmark using multiple Spark workers
(each running in a Docker container) that can be spread across multiple nodes
in a cluster. For more information on running Spark with Docker look at
[cloudsuite/spark:2.4.5][spark-dhrepo].

**Note**: The following commands will run the Spark cluster within host's network. To make sure that slaves and master can communicate with each other, the master container's hostname, which should be host's hostname, must be able to be resolved to the same IP address by the master container and all slave containers. 

First, create a dataset image on every physical node where Spark workers will
be running.

    $ docker create --name movielens-data cloudsuite/movielens-dataset:4.0

Start Spark master and Spark workers. The workers get access to the
datasets with --volumes-from movielens-data.

    $ docker run -dP --net host --name spark-master \
        cloudsuite/spark:2.4.5 master
    $ docker run -dP --net host --volumes-from movielens-data --name spark-worker-01 \
        cloudsuite/spark:2.4.5 worker spark://SPARK-MASTER-IPADDRESS:7077
    $ docker run -dP --net host --volumes-from movielens-data --name spark-worker-02 \
        cloudsuite/spark:2.4.5 worker spark://SPARK-MASTER-IPADDRESS:7077
    $ ...

Finally, run the benchmark as the client to the Spark master:

    $ docker run --rm --net host --volumes-from movielens-data \
                 cloudsuite/in-memory-analytics:4.0 \
                 /data/ml-latest-small /data/myratings.csv \
                 --driver-memory 4g --executor-memory 4g \
                 --master spark://SPARK-MASTER-IPADDRESS:7077

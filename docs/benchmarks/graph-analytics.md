This repository contains the docker image for Cloudsuite's Graph Analytics benchmark.

The Graph Analytics benchmark relies the Spark framework to perform graph analytics on large-scale datasets. Apache provides a graph processing library, GraphX, designed to run on top of Spark. The benchmark performs PageRank on a Twitter dataset.

### Getting the Image

Current version of the benchmark is 4.0. To obtain the image:

    $ docker pull cloudsuite/graph-analytics:4.0

### Datasets

The benchmark uses a graph dataset generated from Twitter. To get the dataset image:

    $ docker pull cloudsuite/twitter-dataset-graph:4.0
    $ docker create --name twitter-data cloudsuite/twitter-dataset-graph:4.0

More information about the dataset is available at
[cloudsuite/twitter-dataset-graph][ml-dhrepo].

### Running/Tweaking the Benchmark

The benchmark runs the PageRank algorithm on GraphX through the spark-submit script distributed with Spark. Any arguments are passed to spark-submit.

For example, to ensure that Spark has enough memory allocated to be able to execute the benchmark in-memory, supply it with --driver-memory and  --executor-memory arguments:

    $ docker run --rm --volumes-from twitter-data cloudsuite/graph-analytics:4.0 \
                 --driver-memory 4g --executor-memory 4g

### Multi-node deployment

This section explains how to run the benchmark using multiple Spark
workers (each running in a Docker container) that can be spread across
multiple nodes in a cluster. For more information on running Spark
with Docker look at [cloudsuite/spark:2.4.5][spark-dhrepo].

**Note**: The following commands will run the Spark cluster within host's network. To make sure that slaves and master can communicate with each other, the master container's hostname, which should be host's hostname, must be able to be resolved to the same IP address by the master container and all slave containers. 

First, create a dataset image on every physical node where Spark
workers will be running.

    $ docker create --name twitter-data cloudsuite/twitter-dataset-graph:4.0

Start Spark master and Spark workers. They should all run within the same Docker network, which we call spark-net here. The workers get access to the datasets with --volumes-from twitter-data.

    $ docker run -dP --net host --name spark-master \
                 cloudsuite/spark:2.4.5 master
    $ docker run -dP --net host --volumes-from twitter-data --name spark-worker-01 \
                 cloudsuite/spark:2.4.5 worker spark://SPARK-MASTER-IPADDRESS:7077
    $ docker run -dP --net host --volumes-from twitter-data --name spark-worker-02 \
                 cloudsuite/spark:2.4.5 worker spark://SPARK-MASTER-IPADDRESS:7077
    $ ...

Finally, run the benchmark as the client to the Spark master:

    $ docker run --rm --net host --volumes-from twitter-data \
                 cloudsuite/graph-analytics:4.0 \
                 --driver-memory 4g --executor-memory 4g \
                 --master spark://SPARK-MASTER-IPADDRESS:7077

## Apache Spark

[![Pulls on DockerHub][dhpulls]][dhrepo]
[![Stars on DockerHub][dhstars]][dhrepo]

This repository contains a Docker image of Apache Spark. Currently we support
Spark versions 2.3.1 for CloudSuite 3.0. 

To obtain the image:

    $ docker pull cloudsuite3/spark

## Running Spark

### Single Container

To try out Spark running in a single container, start the container with:

    $ docker run -it --rm cloudsuite3/spark bash

Spark installation is located under /opt/spark-2.3.1. Try running an example that
calculates Pi with 100 tasks:

    $ /opt/spark-2.3.1/bin/spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
        /opt/spark-2.3.1/lib/spark-examples-2.3.1-hadoop2.6.0.jar 100

You can also run Spark programs using spark-submit without entering the
interactive shell by supplying "submit" as the command to run the image.
Arguments after "submit" are passed to spark-submit. For example, to run the
same example as above type:

    $ docker run --rm cloudsuite3/spark submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
        /opt/spark-2.3.1/lib/spark-examples-2.3.1-hadoop2.6.0.jar 100

Notice that the path to the jar is a path inside the container. You can pass
jars in the host filesystem as arguments if you map the directory where they
reside as a Docker volume.

Finally, you can also start an interactive Spark shell with:

    $ docker run -it --rm cloudsuite3/spark shell

Again, this is just a shortcut for starting a container and running
/opt/spark-2.3.1/bin/spark-shell. Try running a simple parallelized count:

    $ sc.parallelize(1 to 1000).count()

### Multi Container

Usually, we want to run Spark with multiple workers to parallelize some job. In
Docker it is typical to run a single process in a single container. Here we
show how to start a number of workers, a single Spark master that acts as a
coordinator (cluster manager), and submit a job.

First, create a new Docker network. Let's call it spark-net. If we are running
on a single machine, a bridge network will do.

    $ docker network create --driver bridge spark-net

We need to create this new network because Docker does not support automatic
service discovery on the default bridge network.

Start a Spark master:

    $ docker run -dP --net spark-net --hostname spark-master --name spark-master cloudsuite3/spark master

Start a number of Spark workers:

    $ docker run -dP --net spark-net --name spark-worker-01 cloudsuite3/spark worker spark://spark-master:7077
    $ docker run -dP --net spark-net --name spark-worker-02 cloudsuite3/spark worker spark://spark-master:7077
    $ ...

We can monitor our jobs using Spark's web UI. Point your browser to MASTER_IP:8080, where:

    $ MASTER_IP=$(docker inspect --format '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' spark-master)

Finally, to submit a job, we can use any of the methods described in the Single
Container section, with the addition of the network argument to Docker and
spark-master argument to Spark.

Start Spark container with bash and run spark-submit inside it to estimate Pi:

    $ docker run -it --rm --net spark-net cloudsuite3/spark bash
    $ /opt/spark-2.3.1/bin/spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
        --master spark://spark-master:7077 \
        /opt/spark-2.3.1/lib/spark-examples-2.3.1-hadoop2.6.0.jar 100

Start Spark container with "submit" command to estimate Pi:

    $ docker run --rm --net spark-net cloudsuite3/spark submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
        --master spark://spark-master:7077 \
        /opt/spark-2.3.1/lib/spark-examples-2.3.1-hadoop2.6.0.jar 100

Start Spark container with "shell" command and run a parallelized count:

    $ docker run -it --rm --net spark-net cloudsuite3/spark shell --master spark://spark-master:7077
    $ sc.parallelize(1 to 1000).count()

For a multi-node setup, where multiple Docker containers are running on
multiple physical nodes, all commands remain the same if using Docker Swarm as
the cluster manager. The only difference is that the new network needs to be an
overlay network instead of a bridge network.
